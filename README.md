# Soccer League

This is the first project in Treehouse Python tech degree. For practice, I'm rewriting the project using Java.

## Description

You have volunteered to be the Coordinator for your town’s youth soccer league.
As part of your job you need to divide the 18 children who have signed up for the league into three even teams - Dragons, Sharks and Raptors.


In years past, the teams have been unevenly matched, so this year you are doing your best to fix that. For each child,
you will have the following information: Name, height (in inches), whether or not they have played soccer before, and their guardians’ names.
You'll take a list of these children, divide them into teams and output a text file listing the three teams and the players on them.

## Extra Credit

Create 18 text files ("welcome" letters to the players' guardians). You'll create 1 text file for each player.

Use the player’s name as the name of the file, in lowercase and with underscores and ending in .txt.
For example, kenneth_love.txt.

Make sure that each file begins with the text "Dear" followed by the guardian(s) name(s). Also include the additional
required information: player's name, team name, and date & time of first practice.
